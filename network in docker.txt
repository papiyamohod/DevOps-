Types of Network Drivers

bridge: If you build a container without specifying the kind of driver, the container will only be created in the 
bridge network, which is the default network. 

host: Containers will not have any IP address they will be directly created in the system network which 
will remove isolation between the docker host and containers.
 
none: IP addresses wonâ€™t be assigned to containers. These containments are not accessible 
to us from the outside or from any other container.

overlay: overlay network will enable the connection between multiple Docker demons and make different 
Docker swarm services communicate with each other.

ipvlan: Users have complete control over both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing by using the IPvlan driver.
macvlan: macvlan driver makes it possible to assign MAC addresses to a container.
